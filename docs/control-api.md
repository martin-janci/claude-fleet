# claude-fleet Control API (MCP)

claude-fleet embeds a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server. With it enabled, an AI assistant can drive the fleet directly — list
sessions, spawn new ones, send prompts, manage hosts — by calling tools over a
localhost HTTP connection.

The design rationale is in `docs/specs/2026-05-21-control-api-mcp-design.md`.

## Enabling it

The control API is **off by default**. To turn it on:

1. Open **Settings** → **Control API (MCP)**.
2. Tick **Enable control API**. The server starts immediately (no restart);
   the indicator flips to **running**.
3. Note the **URL** (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`, default port `4180`) and
   the **token**. Use **Show** / **Copy** to read the token.

The token is a 256-bit secret generated on first use. Every request must carry
it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The server binds `127.0.0.1` only — it
is never reachable from another machine.

Changing the port or regenerating the token restarts the server. **Regenerate**
invalidates any client still using the old token.

## Connecting a client

The Settings panel has a **MCP client config** block — copy it straight into a
client that reads `mcpServers` JSON (e.g. Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-fleet": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4180/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http claude-fleet http://127.0.0.1:4180/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```

Then, inside a Claude Code session, `/mcp` lists the connected server and its
tools.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fleet_health` | App version, schema version, DB readiness. |
| `list_hosts` / `discover_hosts` | Registered hosts; SSH-config candidates. |
| `add_host` / `remove_host` / `probe_host` / `hide_host` | Host management. |
| `list_accounts` | Cached Claude accounts across hosts. |
| `list_projects` / `refresh_projects` | Projects + worktrees; rescan. |
| `list_sessions` | Reconcile + list all tmux sessions (primary fleet view). |
| `related_sessions` | Sessions sharing a project + worktree. |
| `new_session` / `kill_session` / `rename_session` / `restart_session` | Session lifecycle. |
| `send_prompt` | Deliver a prompt to a running session's Claude REPL. |
| `spawn_review` | Spawn a review session in another session's worktree. |

A typical loop: `list_sessions` to see state → `new_session` to spawn one →
`send_prompt` to steer it.

## Security

- **Localhost only.** The listener binds `127.0.0.1`; this is hard-coded, not
  configurable.
- **Bearer token.** Missing, malformed, or wrong tokens get `401`. The token
  guards against other local processes and against a malicious web page's
  `fetch` (which cannot read the token).
- **Off by default.** No listener exists until you enable it in Settings.
- **Same trust as the UI.** Tools call the same validated, shell-quoted code
  paths the desktop UI uses — the API adds no new SSH-command surface.
- **Audited.** Every tool call is logged to the app's stderr (tool name +
  identifying arguments; prompt bodies are never logged).

## Verifying it works

After enabling the API and connecting a client:

1. **Health** — call `fleet_health`. Expect JSON with the app version and
   `db_ready: true`.
2. **Read** — call `list_sessions`. Expect the same sessions the UI shows.
3. **Auth** — repeat a request with a wrong/absent token. Expect `401`.
4. **Mutate** — `new_session` on the `local` host, then `send_prompt` to it;
   confirm the session and the delivered prompt appear in the desktop UI (the
   UI repaints live — MCP mutations flow through the same event bus).
5. **Lifecycle** — toggle the API off in Settings; the client's connection is
   refused. Toggle it back on; it works again.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Server could not start: … address already in use"** — another process
  holds the port. Pick a different port in Settings and **Apply**.
- **`401 Unauthorized`** — the client's token is stale. Copy the current token
  from Settings, or **Regenerate** and update the client.
- **Client cannot connect at all** — confirm the indicator shows **running**
  and the client URL ends in `/mcp`.
